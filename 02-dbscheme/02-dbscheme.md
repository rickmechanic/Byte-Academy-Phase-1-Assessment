## Problem 2 Database Schema

* Using either a visual SQL schema designer or a CREATE TABLE statement, design a database of states, cities, and parks as follows:

* There are many states, there are many cities, there are many parks.

* Cities have names and population. Every city is in one state.

* Parks have names. Every park is in at least one state, but a park can occupy more than one state. (For instance, Yellowstone is in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana)

* States have names and population.
