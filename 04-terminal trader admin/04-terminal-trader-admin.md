## Phase 1 Assessment Problem 3

#### Terminal Trader Administrator Account

* Modify your seed file to create an administrator account. There should be a column in the database that differentiates account types.

* The Account class should have an attribute or a method that reflects this status. 

* The administrator account should have an additional option in the main menu "see accounts."  Non administrators should not see this view.

* This account should list the other accounts and show their balances. BONUS: also show the other accounts' current positions.

* Write a unit test that verifies that an administrator account loaded from the database has its administrator status reflected in an attribute or a method of the Account class.
